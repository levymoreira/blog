Jekyll is pretty rad and figured releasing a cleaned up version of [my site](http://www.theevilgenius.tk) as a theme for others to hack and build on would be fun. So here be that theme --- I call it **HMFAYSAL V2**, a responsive Jekyll theme with a navigation drawer, large featured images and solid typography.
